🧠 Internship Project – Java-Based File Handling Utility (May 2025)
This repository documents the progress and deliverables of my internship starting 14th May 2025, focusing on developing a File Handling Utility in Java. This is the first major task of my internship, and it will be completed within 7–10 days.

📅 Timeline
Date	Activity

14/05/2025	📌 Internship started – Introduced to project scope

15/05/2025	🔍 Researched Java I/O libraries and file systems

16/05/2025	🛠️ Started building core file operations (read/write/copy/delete)

17/05/2025	✅ Implemented file creation and modification functions

18/05/2025	✅ Added support for recursive directory operations

19/05/2025	🧪 Performed testing and exception handling

20/05/2025	✅ Finalized UI (CLI-based) and packaged the utility

21/05/2025	📦 Documentation and GitHub upload

🔧 Task 1: File Handling Utility in Java 📁
📝 Description:
Created a robust command-line based file handling tool in Java that supports key file and directory operations. Designed for portability and ease of use across different platforms.

📌 Features:
✅ Create, read, write, copy, rename, and delete files

📂 Create and manage directories

🔁 Recursive directory traversal and operations

🔒 Exception-safe with detailed logging

🧪 Simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) for user interaction

⚙️ Technologies Used:
Category	Tools / Libraries
Language	Java
I/O Handling	java.io, java.nio.file
Utilities	java.util, Scanner, File, Path, Files
Logging & Errors	Try-Catch blocks, Custom error messages
UI	CLI (Command-Line Interface)

🛠️ Main Functions Implemented:
Function Name	Purpose
createFile()	Creates a new file at a specified path
writeToFile()	Writes/overwrites data into a file
readFromFile()	Reads content from a file
copyFile()	Copies a file from one location to another
deleteFile()	Deletes a specified file
createDirectory()	Creates a new directory
listDirectoryContents()	Recursively lists all contents in directory
renameFileOrDirectory()	Renames a file or folder

🚀 Summary
This task helped me strengthen my Java programming fundamentals and enhanced my skills in:

Handling files and directories in real-world scenarios

Using Java’s core I/O packages efficiently

Building robust, user-friendly command-line tools

Managing error handling, logging, and edge cases

✅ This project is actively maintained, and progress was tracked daily from 14–21 May 2025.
